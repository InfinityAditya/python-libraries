## ✨ Introduction & Data Science Workflow

Welcome to the heart of practical Data Science in Python! This repository contains a curated series of Colab notebooks designed to teach you the **core three libraries** that power almost every data project: **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.**

The notebooks are organized to follow a typical data science workflow:
1.  **Data Acquisition & Cleaning** (Pandas Focus)
2.  **Numerical Computing & Array Manipulation** (NumPy Focus)
3.  **Visualization & Storytelling** (Matplotlib Focus)

## 🚀 How to Use (Start Your Analysis Now!)

1.  **🚀 Easiest Way (Recommended):** Click the **'Open in Colab'** badge next to any notebook. This instantly launches the file in your browser, ready to run.
2.  **👯 Clone the Repo:** For local Jupyter/IDE use, clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/InfinityAditya/python-libraries.git](https://github.com/InfinityAditya/python-libraries.git)
    cd python-libraries
    ```
3.  **Required Environment:** Ensure you have Python installed, along with the core libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).

## 🤯 Fun Project Idea: Building a Dashboard

To make learning fun and crazy, challenge yourself with a project that forces you to use all three libraries together:

* **Project:** **COVID-19/Weather Data Analysis Mini-Dashboard**
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Pandas:** Load a public dataset (e.g., Kaggle COVID-19 data). Use `pandas_date_and_time.ipynb` to clean and prepare the dates. Use `pandas_groupby.ipynb` to aggregate cases by month.
    2.  **NumPy:** Use NumPy's functions for quick statistical checks (e.g., finding the standard deviation of daily new cases).
    3.  **Matplotlib:** Create a multi-plot visualization (`matplotlib_advanced.ipynb`) showing a line chart of cumulative cases, a bar chart of monthly deaths, and a scatter plot of a related variable.

## 🔗 Impressive Learning Links: Cheat Sheets & Handbooks

These resources are essential for quick lookups and advanced topics:

* **NumPy User Guide:** The official, in-depth guide.
* **Pandas 10 Minutes to Pandas:** A rapid-fire introduction to the library's core features.
* **Matplotlib Gallery:** Hundreds of examples to learn advanced plotting techniques.
* **DataCamp Cheat Sheets:** Excellent visual guides for NumPy and Pandas syntax.
